# Hytale Override Mappings
# Format: minecraft:block_name=Hytale_Block_Name
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Empty lines are ignored
#
# Example:
# minecraft:stone=Rock_Stone
# modname:custom_block=Rock_Stone
#
# Note: The Minecraft key must contain at least one colon (:)
# The Hytale block name will be validated against the BlockType asset map
# If the block doesn't exist, it will default to Rock_Stone and log a warning
#
# set an item to 'skip' to prevent it from being processed. this would be similar to the -a flag with WorldEdit if you set minecraft:air to skip
# set an item to "Empty" to make it replace the blocks with air. this would be similar to worldedits default behavior if minecraft:air is mapped to Empty
