# Legacy Block Override Mappings
# Format: blockId:dataValue=minecraft:block_name
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Empty lines are ignored
#
# Example:
# 1:0=minecraft:stone
# 50=minecraft:chest
# 159:1=minecraft:orange_terracotta
#
# blocks like torches, chests use the second int (data) as rotational information. for these block overrides, enter them as the example above
# blocks like terracotta use data as colors, ex. 159 is hardened clay. a value of 1 provides orange color.
# The modern block name can use any namespace but one must be specified. ex, minecraft:stone
